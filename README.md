# Root2Remedy ♍︎
An application designed to digitally preserve, explore, and share traditional and holistic healing practices and techniques passed through generations.



## ☘️ **Project Overview**
**Root2Remedy** seeks to merge oral tradition with modern technology. Users will have access to an archive of herbal remedies, spiritual rituals, and home-based healing approach, while also having the option to contribute their own. 

## **Key Features** 🔑
1. ### **Remedy Submission & Community Archive** 🗂️

    Users can manually submit remedies passed down through generations, along with personal stories, rituals, or cultural significance behind them. Each submission will be added to the **Root2Remedy** archive. This archive will serve as a digital time capsule where communities can learn from one another and preserve this traditional knowledge. 

2. ### **Symptom - Based Search** 🔎

   Users can input specific health symptoms or concerns (like "sore throat" or "inflammation") to discover related remedies. The results will feature both modern and traditional health methods across cultures. 

3. ### **Interactive Healing Map** 🗺️

    An interactive healing map will display the geographical roots of remedies, herbal traditions, and practices. 

4. ### **Botanical Library** 📚

    A digital botanical library that features a wide array of herbs, roots, and minerals. Each entry will include the name, traditional and modern uses, toxicity warnings, cultural footnotes, and dosage guidelines. This library will serve as a reference and educational guide for users.

The **Root2Remedy** application will be an ideal application for **educators** and **students** who are interested in traditional / holistic healing, **herbalists** and **doulas**. **Families** and **individuals** interested in preserving and reclaiming their generational knowledge. 


## **Why is this Important?** 💡
Modern medicine, as we know it today, has deep historical roots in traditional and holistic healing practices. Long before large pharmaceutical companies dominated healthcare, communities relied on plants, roots, and minerals for their health. Those who cared for the sick were known as healers, midwives, herbalists, shamans, etc. These practices were rooted within the culture and community.
